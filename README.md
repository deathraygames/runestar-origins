# Runestar: Origins

Based on the _Dwarves-in-Space_ setting from the [Runestar micro-RPG](http://deathraygames.com/tabletop-roleplaying/runestar/RuneStar_v1.pdf) ([pdf](http://deathraygames.com/tabletop-roleplaying/runestar/RuneStar_v1.pdf), [rpggeek](https://rpggeek.com/rpgitem/190198/runestar)), this game is meant to tell the tale of the origins of the space-faring society through a dungeon-delving Rougelike.

This game is beginning as a 7DRL game, starting from the rote-js "Pedro" demo, and will include many modifications to the rote-js libraries along the way.
